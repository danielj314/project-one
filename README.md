-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The three main colours used are red, white and black. These compliment the footage and photographs of the live shows that are used on the website.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Arimo font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Arimo is clean and attractive, and appropriate. The "Permanent Marker" font will be used for headings. it is clearly readable and adds character to the site, which reflects the band's strong sound.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important to express the style of the band. A large, background hero image on each page is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It gives the visitor an imediate idea of the style of music that the band plays.
    -   #### Audio
        -   The most important aspect of any band is the music. The site will ensure visitors can easily listen to the band via various media sites.

 ### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals


    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.

        1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a Hero Image with Text and a "watch us!" call to action.
        2. The main points are made immediately with the hero image.
        3. The user can then scroll down, which will lead to information about how to watch the band, either live or on their screen.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to navigate throughout the site easily to find the content I need.

        1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what information will be located on each page.
        2. At the bottom of each there are links to further relevant sites and pages to ensure the user doesnt get trapped.
        3. On the sign up Page, after a form response is submitted, a new page will open in a separate tab to assure the user that the form has been submitted.

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to understand what kind of music the band plays and what their live shows are like. I also want to know who the band bembers are and locate their social media links in order to get to know them better.

        1. Once the new visitor has watched some videos of recent shows on the home page they can move on to the about page to get to know the band members individually.
        2. There are social media links for the individual band members located under their profiles on the about me page and there are links to the band's social media pages at the bottom of each page in the footer..

-   #### Returning Visitor Goals


    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find information regarding upcoming shows.

        1. Upcoming shows are listed on the homepage.

    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to purchase tickets for shows.

        1. Below the upcoming shows section there is a button that directs the user to a ticket selling webpage in another tab.
        2. There is a link to the ticket sales website on the footer of each page of the website.


-   #### Frequent User Goals

    1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new show dates added.

        1. The user should be comfortable enough with the website layout having visited before.

    2. As a Frequent User, I want to sign up to the newsletter so that I am emailed any major updates and/or changes to the website or organisation.

        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily find links in the menu, or footer section to access the sugn up page.

    3. As a Frequent User, I want to sign up to the Newsletter so that I am emailed any major updates and/or changes to the website or organisation.
        1. At the bottom of every page their is a footer which content is consistent throughout all pages.
        2. To the right hand side of the footer the user can see "Subscribe to our Newsletter" and are prompted to Enter their email address.
        3. There is a "Submit" button to the right hand side of the input field which is located close to the field and can easily be distinguished.

### Content

-   All content was written by the developer, apart from the footer section which has been labelled with an acknowledgement.

-   Footer code copied from https://www.web-eau.net/blog/10-best-footer-html-css-snippets but modified by myself to create desired look.

-   When the sign-up form is submitted, the The sign up completed page is simply a link to a google image. This would be changed in future when I have deloped my javascript coding skills.

### Media

-   All images downloaded from https://www.pexels.com/ a free stock photo library.
-   The music videos on the site are linked from https://www.youtube.com/ . As the band is fictional another band's music videos were linked as example pieces.

### Acknowledgements

-   Tutor support at Code Institute for their support.


### Bugs

-   Menu items displaying back to front when floating list items left. I solved this with a google search to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20920265/horizontal-menu-how-to-float-right-but-keep-the-menu-items-in-the-correct-order
there was a piece of example code wich showed how to re-order the list items in the menu. I had to float the entire ul right, instead of only the li.

-   Hero image appearing behind header: this was resolved by re-watching tutorial videos provided by Code institute in the css module.

-   3 columns on about page wouldnt stay on one row. I finally figured out it was because i was adding a margin to the collumns, thus increasing the size of each, meaning three columns covering 1/3 of the screen each could not fit onto one row. I realised that if I reduced the column size in CSS from 33.3% to 32%, I could then add a margin between the columns.

-   Hero image was stretching to fit screen. I searched google and found a solution at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1733006/how-to-set-an-images-width-and-height-without-stretching-it which advised using the code "object-fit: cover;" in css.
